            The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. TVM is also referred to as present discounted value.<br><br>Money deposited in a savings account earns a certain interest rate. Rational investors prefer to receive money today rather than the same amount of money in the future because of money's potential to grow in value over a given period of time. Money earning an interest rate is said to be compounding in value.<br><br>Basic Time Value of Money Formula and Example Depending on the exact situation in question, the TVM formula may change slightly. For example, in the case of annuity or perpetuity payments, the generalized formula has additional or less factors. <br>But in general, the most fundamental TVM formula takes into account the following variables:<br> FV = Future value of money<br> PV = Present value of money<br> i = interest rate<br> n = number of compounding periods per year<br> t = number of years<br> Based on these variables, the formula for TVM is:<br> FV = PV x (1 + (i / n)) ^ (n x t)<br> For example, assume a sum of $10,000 is invested for one year at 10% interest. The future value of that money is:<br> FV = $10,000 x (1 + (10% / 1) ^ (1 x 1) = $11,000<br> The formula can also be rearranged to find the value of the future sum in present day dollars. For example, the value of $5,000 one year from today, compounded at 7% interest, is:<br> PV = $5,000 / (1 + (7% / 1) ^ (1 x 1) = $4,673<sup>I</sup>

        <h3>The World in 2100</h3>
        <p>
            The world population is growing at a gradually slower and slower pace, but it's still growing substantially. Currently, the world adds about 83 million people per year, equivalent to roughly the population of Germany. But population growth has slowed to 1.18 percent per year from 1.24 percent a decade ago.<br><br>The UN expects population growth to continue to gradually level off. Global population is almost sure to rise in the short term but the UN says there is a 1 in 4 chance that the world population will stabilize or fall before 2100.<br><br>How accurate are these predictions? In the past, the UN has had a pretty good track record with its population predictions, as In 1948 it projected world population would be around 6 billion in 2000, only less than five percent off from what it was that year, Khokar points out.<br><br>As the saying goes, past performance is no guarantee. There are a few factors that could skew these results. One that the UN mentions in its report is how fast the birth rate falls in countries where women currently have a lot of kids. The UN is expecting fertility to fall substantially, but that will hinge on things like investments in women’s health and expanded access to birth control. Africa is expected to more than double its population by 2100. Africa currently accounts for 16 percent of the global population. The UN expects that proportion to rise to 25 percent in 2050 and 49 percent by 2100.<br><br>That's mostly because the continent is so young, and partly because fertility rates are high. Exactly half of the continent's population was under the age of 24 in 2015. Many of these people will have children of their own in the next few decades, adding greatly to the global total. Nigeria's population will be bigger than that of the U.S. before long. The country is expected to surpass America by about 2050 to become the third largest country in the world, the UN says. At that point, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the U.S. will all have populations of more than 300 million.<sup>II</sup>

        <h3>GMO Food</h3>
        <p>
            Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be defined as organisms (i.e. plants, animals or microorganisms) in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The technology is often called “modern biotechnology” or “gene technology”, sometimes also “recombinant DNA technology” or “genetic engineering”. It allows selected individual genes to be transferred from one organism into another, also between nonrelated species. Foods produced from or using GM organisms are often referred to as GM foods.<br><br>GM foods are developed – and marketed – because there is some perceived advantage either to the producer or consumer of these foods. This is meant to translate into a product with a lower price, greater benefit (in terms of durability or nutritional value) or both. Initially GM seed developers wanted their products to be accepted by producers and have concentrated on innovations that bring direct benefit to farmers (and the food industry generally).<br><br>One of the objectives for developing plants based on GM organisms is to improve crop protection. The GM crops currently on the market are mainly aimed at an increased level of crop protection through the introduction of resistance against plant diseases caused by insects or viruses or through increased tolerance towards herbicides.<br><br>Resistance against insects is achieved by incorporating into the food plant the gene for toxin production from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This toxin is currently used as a conventional insecticide in agriculture and is safe for human consumption. GM crops that inherently produce this toxin have been shown to require lower quantities of insecticides in specific situations, e.g. where pest pressure is high. Virus resistance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from certain viruses which cause disease in plants. Virus resistance makes plants less susceptible to diseases caused by such viruses, resulting in higher crop yields.Herbicide tolerance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from a bacterium conveying resistance to some herbicides. In situations where weed pressure is high, the use of such crops has resulted in a reduction in the quantity of the herbicides used.<sup>III</sup>
